# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project develops and evaluates three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Network for handwritten digit recognition. Two image preprocessing methods standardize external test images for compatibility with the models. Implemented in PyTorch and trained on the MNIST dataset, the project offers a streamlined approach to compare model performance.
